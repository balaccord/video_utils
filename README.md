## sony_extract_srt.py

Extracts the Sony (probably the other brands too) video files metadata as the SRT subtitles

Usage: run `python sony_extract_srt.py` in the directory containing the original camera video files

Sorry, works under the Windows only. Probably will work in MacOS/Linux, too, with the minimal changes but, as for now, it don't

The following prerequisites should be installed:

- [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (the other versions have not been checked)
- [ExifTools](https://exiftool.org/) (not too old)

The path to the exiftool executable should be set below in order this to run properly
